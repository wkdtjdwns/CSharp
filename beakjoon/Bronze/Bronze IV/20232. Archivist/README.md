Help the contest archivist to remember the results of each contest and write a program that will read the year and print contest winners of that year in exactly the same format as above.

## 입력

The only line of input contains a single integer 𝑦 (1995 ≤ 𝑦 ≤ 2019), denoting the year. You don't need to process year numbers less than 1995$1995$ or greater than 2019$2019$, or incorrect year formats. It is guaranteed that you will be given a number between 1995$1995$ and 2019$2019$, inclusive.

## 출력

Print the winner of the contest in year 𝑦$y$ exactly in the same format as in the list above.
